this folder contains auto generated .txt files with statistic data for each device.
when device becomes "online" , statistic data file for the device (if not exists) is created and it stores (gathers) the data that is coming from the GST device (updates from the device).
when device goes "offline" statistic data in the file (specific file for the device) is removed but the file remains for later when device comes "online" again.
